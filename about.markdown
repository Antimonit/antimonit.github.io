Hi! Just in case it was not obvious from the page header, my name is David Khol.
I am an avid software engineer coming from Czech Republic living my dream in Seoul, South Korea.
I work as an Android developer at [LINE][line] where I strive to improve the code quality and the architecture of the [LINE Pay][line-pay] feature.

I occasionally put up some articles about Android, Gradle, Kotlin or programming in general, usually when something noteworthy comes up at work.

I studied at [Czech Technical University in Prague][ctu] where I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering with honours in 2015 and a Master's degree, also in Software Engineering, in 2018.
During my studies, I went to Korea as an exchange student to Seoul National University of Science and Technology in 2014, University of Seoul in 2016 and Ajou University in 2017.
